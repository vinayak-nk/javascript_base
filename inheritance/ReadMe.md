1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
=================
Abstraction means hiding certain details that don't matter to the user and only showing essential features or functions.

Encapsulation means keeping properties and methods private inside a class, so that they are not accessible from outside that class.

Inheritance makes all properties and methods available to a child class. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships.

Polymorphism means having different and many forms. We can overwrite a method inherited from a parent class.
